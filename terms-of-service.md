Twitter Bot Terms of Service
==============

Last revised on 25/01/2022

### Basic rules
All Twitter Bot users must follow the [Discord community guidelines](https://discord.com/guidelines) both inside and outside of Twitter Bot. 

### The Gist

Xenyte operates the Twitter Bot service, which we hope you use. If you use it, please use it responsibly. If you don't, we'll have to block you from our services.

The Terms of Service, Xenyte itself, and our services can change at any time. We'll try to warn you about major changes to the Terms of Service, but we make no guarantees.

That's the basic idea, but You must read through the entire Terms of Service below and agree with all the details before You use any of our services.

### Your Agreement with Xenyte

In order to use the Service, You (the "Customer", "You", or "Your") must first agree to the Terms. You understand and agree that Xenyte will treat Your use of the Service as acceptance of the Terms from that point onwards.

Xenyte may make changes to the Terms from time to time. You may reject the changes by deleting your data and opting out of all features. You understand and agree that if You use the Service after the date on which the Terms have changed, Xenyte will treat Your use as acceptance of the updated Terms.
