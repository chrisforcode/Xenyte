Last revised on 25/01/2022

### Contact information
Join the [Twitter Bot support Discord server](https://discord.gg/4ru95RgHqu) or send an email to chrisloowonline@gmail.com for questions or anything else regarding Twitter Bot.

### Personal data being collected
Personal data is collected by Twitter Bot to ensure that all users have the best possible experience. This data is only collected when a user creates a tweet. When a user stops using Twitter Bot, his/her data will automatically be deleted within 30 days. Upon removing Twitter Bot from a Discord server, it will stop collecting data on that Discord server. The exact personal data being stored is listed below.

#### Tweet
- The message that is displayed.

#### User
- Username.
- Nickname on the server.

### How personal data is being collected
Whenever someone sends a message, Twitter Bot will check if the message was sent in the channel where messages should be converted into tweets. Upon detecting that a message should be converted into a tweet, the content of the message, author and nickname of the author will be stored using the [Discord API](https://discord.com/developers/docs/reference).

### How long is personal data being collected
Personal data is being collected for the duration of 30 days. This means that any personal data older than 30 days will be deleted. The reason behind this duration is that it is required to interact with a tweet for 30 days. When personal data is deleted from a tweet, interacting with it won't work anymore.

### Why personal data is being collected
When a message is converted into an image representing a tweet, the original message will be deleted. At this point it is impossible to retrieve the content of this message and who originally created it. Therefore, this data will temporarily be stored to allow users to interact with the tweet. Interactions include retweets and likes.

Data collected by Twitter Bot will never be sold to third parties.

### How to opt-out of features
It is possible to opt-out of all features by using the `/twitter delete` command. As Twitter Bot's main feature is converting messages into images that represent tweets, this will opt the user out of that feature.

### Data protection
Twitter Bot safely stores data and a there's a lot being done to prevent potential vulnerabilities.
